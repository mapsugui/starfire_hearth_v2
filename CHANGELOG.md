# Changelog

Newest first. A claim marked **Verified** names the command that proved it, run from the
repository root after `godot --headless --path . --import`. Everything else is **Unverified**.

## Unreleased: M1, First Light (in progress)

### Simulation: the Scenario 1 rules (DESIGN_LOG 51–84)

- State schema 2 (research branches, build queues, governors, ordinances, surveys, modifiers,
  events, the event log, objectives, famine and autonomy counters) with migration `v1_to_v2`.
  **Verified:** `godot --headless --path . -s tests/run_tests.gd`: the M0 fixture save still loads
  and passes the invariants, and a new schema 2 fixture (`tests/fixtures/saves/s1_v2.json`, 16
  scripted turns of Scenario 1) does too.
- Rules in `sim/rules/`, each with breakdowns: economy (jobs by priority, district and colony
  bonuses, flat upkeep and consumption, industry input and mineral shortages, caps and overflow,
  influence), population (growth, homelessness, famine), stability (every §5.4 source, bands,
  unrest and autonomy), research (costs, seeded hands, carry-over, rerolls, story and objective
  techs), construction (queues, tiers, adjacency, building limits, demolition, rushing),
  governors (advisor plans with reasons, purses, vetoes), ordinances, civilian ships (surveys,
  outposts, colonisation), the market, objectives and the tutorial. **Verified:** the test run
  above: 135 passed, 0 failed, 1,196 checks, including Aster's starting numbers against §5
  (food +13.00, energy +10.00, minerals +11.00, research 1.80 per branch, influence +4.00,
  housing 20, stability 67).
- Event engine: triggers from a closed set of conditions with Why? reasons, scripted and status
  chains, a paced director (at most one emergent event every 4–6 turns), choices with costs,
  lasting modifiers, "Uncertain" outcomes on the EVENTS stream, delayed chain steps, and the
  log. **Verified:** `--filter events` (7 tests).
- 21 new commands, each validated with a reason (districts, upgrades, demolition, buildings,
  ships, queue edits, rushing, research picks and rerolls, ordinances, governors, vetoes,
  surveys, outposts, colonising, event choices, tutorial steps, trades). **Verified:**
  `--filter commands` (every type round-trips through the registry).
- **Golden re-baseline.** Reason: "M1: the economy, events and orders run in every phase; schema
  2". New golden: 24 scripted turns of Scenario 1 (`tests/golden/s1_hashes.json`). **Verified:**
  `--filter golden` (4 tests, including a save and load at every turn).

### Audio (DESIGN_LOG 88)

- `Audio` autoload: UI, Effects and Music buses under Master; UI, effects and music volumes and
  mute in `Settings` (saved); every §15.4 sound by id, from its delivered file or, until then, a
  blip synthesised from a recipe in `app/sound_synth.gd` (soft, D major pentatonic, the same
  samples every time); music cues per screen (the main theme on the title and campaign, the
  scenario's briefing and main tracks, a sting at the debrief) that crossfade and stay silent
  until the tracks are delivered. Buttons, overlays, pinned breakdowns, warning toasts and End
  Turn make their sounds. `tools/audio_preview.gd` writes every fallback to WAV with a length and
  peak report; CI uploads them as the `audio-preview` artifact. **Verified:** `--filter audio`
  (5 tests: buses follow the settings, all 40 ids have a fallback or are a bed, lengths 0.05 to
  2.22 s, peaks at most 0.85, deterministic renders, silent music cues, UI sounds) and
  `godot --headless --path . -s tools/audio_preview.gd` (39 sounds written).

### Screens: the app shell and the campaign flow (DESIGN_LOG 85–87)

- `AppRoot` (`ui/screens/app_root.tscn`) hosts one screen at a time and routes title → campaign →
  briefing → game → debrief, plus the showcase in debug builds. Only screens that exist are
  offered; until the game screen lands, a stand-in names the game that Begin started. Not yet the
  main scene: the showcase stays the main scene until the M1 screen work is complete.
- Title (the sky with lane pulses, or the painted key art once delivered; Continue opens the newest
  save that loads), campaign select (the difficulty preset, three scenario cards: ready, won with
  its legacy, locked until the one before is won, or not in this build), briefing (Archivist
  Sola, the briefing, required and optional objectives, the difficulty, Begin) and debrief (the
  outcome and why, the objectives as they ended, the legacy pick after a win; Try again after a
  loss). Phones scroll the scenario cards sideways and put each screen's buttons in its heading
  row. `CampaignProgress` holds the difficulty, wins and legacy picks for the session.
  **Verified:** `godot --headless --path . -s tests/run_tests.gd -- --filter flow_screens` (2
  tests: the whole flow driven through the AppRoot, and the id audit on 8 screen states as a PC
  and a phone at 100% and 200% text, 0 issues) and `--filter campaign_progress` (3 tests).
- Fixed: a tab button marked pressed before it entered the tree lost the mark, so the showcase's
  page and text-size tabs never showed which was selected. Fixed: a portrait's shoulders were
  drawn outside its disc, over the text beside it. **Verified:** the full suite (143 passed, 0
  failed, 1,498 checks) and `xvfb-run -a -s "-screen 0 2560x1600x24" godot --rendering-driver
  opengl3 --path . -s tools/screenshot_tour.gd -- --out screens/` (68 screenshots, 0 audit
  issues).

### Display building blocks for the M1 screens

- Effects as readable text (`sim/explain/effect_text.gd`), with signed number arguments in the
  string layer. New components: `EffectList`, `CostChips`, and code placeholders for story scenes
  (`StoryScene`) and speaking characters (`Portrait`), drawn from `data/vignettes.json` and
  `data/portraits.json`. `AssetIds` resolves a §15 id to a delivered file, or to nothing while
  outsourcing is on hold. **Verified:** `--filter effect_text` (3 tests, 221 checks: every effect
  in every event choice reads without a raw placeholder).
- `docs/BUILD_PROMPT.md` rewrite 4: M1 progress, the balance status, the screen plan and where to
  resume. Documentation only.

### Content

- Scenario 1 is playable: the full start state (Ark Hull, Spaceport, both ships, seeded research
  hands), 4 required and 3 optional objectives, 14 tutorial steps, loss rules, locked
  ordinances, the tech pool and the balance scope. Cinder is now a small dome world (DESIGN_LOG
  66).
- 16 event chains with 36 fully written steps: The Founders' Vote, Cold Sleepers, Labor Strike,
  The Sealed Order (steps 1–2), The Ark's Last Engine; the status chains Unrest, Empty Granaries
  and Envoys of the Autonomy; and 8 emergent chains (Solar Flare, Crop Blight, Mine Collapse,
  Founding Day, The Frontier Doctor, Refugee Slowboat, Ice Comet Capture, Orbital Debris
  Cascade). Every body is 60–140 words. **Verified:** `godot --headless --path . -s
  tools/validate_data.gd`: 0 errors, 0 skipped checks, including the new reachability walk and
  event word counts.

### Bots and balance telemetry

- Bot policies balanced, economy, turtle and random-legal play the whole scenario through the
  same commands as a player; per-turn telemetry now records income, gross income, caps,
  overflow, builds, techs, events, objectives and the outcome. `tools/telemetry_report.gd`
  computes all five balance gates. **Verified** on 6 seeds per policy (105 turns, Normal):
  balanced wins 6 of 6 (median win turn 79; expected 70); random-legal wins 0 of 6; no dead
  turns; end-turn p95 34 ms. On CI, 20 seeds per policy plus Story (run 36006538014): balanced
  20/20 on Normal and 20/20 on Story, median win turn 78; random-legal 0/20; end-turn p95 36 ms.
  **Failing, still being tuned:** no hoarding (80 of 80 runs: food early, metals after the
  colony ships, influence, energy), everything matters (Foundry 0%, Research Institute 1%,
  Fusion Plant 3%, Hydroponics Bay 11%), and the balanced win rate on Normal is above the 60–90%
  band.

## After M0

- Display renames and units (Owner request, DESIGN_LOG 42): Metals (was Alloys), Ordinance (was
  Edict), settlers (1 pop = 1,000), and units kt, GW, Mt, kt on food, energy, minerals and metals
  in breakdowns, rate labels and the "More" drawer. Internal ids are unchanged. **Verified:**
  `godot --headless --path . -s tools/validate_data.gd` (0 errors, 420 strings),
  `godot --headless --path . -s tests/run_tests.gd` (85 passed), and the screenshot tour (68
  screenshots, 0 audit issues), with `screens/pc_100/02_breakdown_pinned.png` inspected.
- Art and sound direction (Owner, DESIGN_LOG 45–49): a flat interface over "painted diorama"
  world art; a visual-novel-style soundtrack with character themes and mood cues from M1; ships
  as top-down painted sprites; portraits with optional expressions; §15 briefs rewritten to match.
  Documentation only.
- The web build budget is 150 MB as the compressed download (Owner). The CI size step now checks
  150,000,000 bytes. **Unverified** until the next CI run.
- `docs/BUILD_PROMPT.md`: the rewritten build brief (status, the full game, remaining milestones,
  and outsourcing briefs with an intake contract for sound, music, VFX and art). Documentation
  only.

## 0.1.0-m0: foundation and UI kit (not released)

### Breakdowns at large text sizes

- Breakdown panels widen with the text scale, capped by the screen (DESIGN_LOG 40). At 200% on
  the phone, "Fertile Soil (planet trait)" had wrapped to a word per line beside its value; it
  now fits on one line. **Verified:** the screenshot tour (0 audit issues) and a look at
  `screens/phone_200/02_breakdown_pinned.png` and `screens/pc_200/02_breakdown_pinned.png`.

### Web build: phone and tablet detection, smoke test

- The web build now recognises tablets whose browser reports a desktop system (iPadOS Safari
  says macOS) by their touch pointer (DESIGN_LOG 36), and prints the layout it chose to the
  browser console. Before the fix an iPad got the PC layout with 24-pixel targets.
  **Verified:** `node tools/web_smoke.mjs --build build/web --out screens/web` reports PC
  "wide, pointer", Android phone "compact, touch", iPad "compact, touch".
- New `tools/web_smoke.mjs` opens the exported web build in headless Chromium as a PC, an
  Android phone (873x393 at 2.75x) and an iPad, and fails on a console error, a boot that
  stalls, or the wrong layout class. **Verified:** the command above: 3 of 3 devices passed,
  each engine start under 2 s.

### CI and exports

- GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): import, data validation, tests, bot
  smoke test with a determinism replay (2 policies x 3 seeds x 60 turns), telemetry gates,
  palette report, screenshot tour and id audit under xvfb, icon sheet, Web, Windows and Linux
  exports, web size check, web smoke test, artifacts, and a GitHub Pages deploy from `main`.
  **Verified:** [run 35977347923](https://github.com/mapsugui/starfire_hearth_v2/actions/runs/35977347923)
  passed every job on its first run; the deploy job only runs on `main`.
- Export presets for Web (single-threaded, so no special server headers), Windows and Linux.
  **Verified:** `godot --headless --path . --export-release "Web" build/web/index.html` (and
  `"Windows"`, `"Linux"`) exit 0. The Linux build ran the showcase for 240 frames with no
  script errors: `xvfb-run -a ./build/linux/StarfireHearth.x86_64 --rendering-driver opengl3
  --quit-after 240`. The Windows build has not been run (**Unverified**).
- Web build size: 40,795,000 bytes on disk, 11,015,704 bytes as a gzip download. **Verified:**
  `du -sb build/web`, and `gzip -9 -c` of each file (the CI step). How the budget is read:
  DESIGN_LOG 37.
- Content folders that hold only a placeholder are optional at run time, so exported builds
  start without "missing folder" errors; the validator still requires them in the repository
  (DESIGN_LOG 35). **Verified:** the Linux run above, and
  `godot --headless --path . -s tools/validate_data.gd` (0 errors).

### Review tools

- `tools/icon_sheet.gd` renders the icon contact sheet: 87 icons, filled and outlined, at 24
  and 16 px, grouped and named. **Verified:** `xvfb-run -a godot --rendering-driver opengl3
  --path . -s tools/icon_sheet.gd -- --out screens/icon_sheet.png` wrote a 1680x2346 PNG, which
  I inspected.
- `tools/palette_report.gd` prints WCAG contrast for text colours on every panel colour, and
  ΔE separation of the colour pairs that carry meaning, for normal vision and under a
  deuteranopia simulation. **Verified:** `godot --headless --path . -s tools/palette_report.gd`:
  every text colour is at least 4.56:1; three pairs are flagged LOW (see the M0 report).

### UI kit, showcase, screenshot tour and id audit

- Theme built at run time from tokens, with text scale 100 to 200%, a compact (phone) class,
  touch sizing and high contrast (DESIGN_LOG 12, 14). IBM Plex Sans and Mono.
- Components: `Explainable` (hover 300 ms, click to pin, tap, long-press; nested breakdowns two
  levels deep), `BreakdownTooltip`, `ResourceChip`, `Card`, `Modal`, `Toast`, `Drawer`,
  `BottomSheet`, `SfTabs`, `HexCell`, button variants, `Meter`, `NoiseWave`, `TopBar`.
- `Layout` and `Overlay` autoloads (DESIGN_LOG 15).
- 87 SVG icons with filled and outlined variants, procedural star and planet renderers.
- Showcase scene (the M0 main scene) with every component on sample data.
- `tools/screenshot_tour.gd` renders 17 showcase states as a PC (1920x1080) and a phone
  (2400x1080, 440 dpi, touch), each at 100% and 200% text, plus deuteranopia copies;
  `tools/id_audit.gd` checks raw ids, overlap, clipping, broken words, 48 dp targets and numbers
  outside an `Explainable`. **Verified:** `xvfb-run -a -s "-screen 0 2560x1600x24" godot
  --rendering-driver opengl3 --path . -s tools/screenshot_tour.gd -- --out screens/`: 68
  screenshots, 0 audit issues, 102 exemptions (the three text-size buttons in each of the 34 PC
  renders). I looked at every PNG.
- **Verified:** `godot --headless --path . -s tests/run_tests.gd -- --filter ui_audit` (the same
  audit on the headless showcase, 5 cases) and `--filter tokens` (WCAG AA for every text token)
  pass.

### Data, validator, strings, bot runner and telemetry

- `data/` holds every file of §9.2. Resources, jobs, districts, planet types, planet sizes,
  traits, factions and origins are real; buildings, techs, hulls, modules, edicts, treaties,
  personalities, difficulty, vignettes and portraits are empty stubs until M1 (DESIGN_LOG 28).
  Scenario 1 is a stub start state (Ember, Aster's colony and fogged neighbours).
- `tools/validate_data.gd`: shape, cross-references, string keys both ways, two sinks per
  resource, closed effect keys, colour tokens, icon names. Reachability reports SKIP until a
  scenario is playable. **Verified:** `godot --headless --path . -s tools/validate_data.gd`: 18
  tables, 47 records, 415 strings, 0 errors, 1 skipped check. `tests/fixtures/bad_data/` proves
  each check fires (`--filter data`, 6 tests pass).
- `strings/en.csv` with 415 keys, loaded at run time into a Translation (DESIGN_LOG 11).
- `tools/bot_run.gd` (balanced and random-legal policies, per-turn telemetry, determinism
  replay) and `tools/telemetry_report.gd` (PASS, FAIL or SKIP per gate). **Verified:**
  `godot --headless --path . -s tools/bot_run.gd -- --scenario s1 --policy balanced --seeds 1-3
  --turns 60 --out telemetry --check-determinism` (and `--policy random-legal`), then
  `godot --headless --path . -s tools/telemetry_report.gd -- --in telemetry`: invariants PASS,
  determinism PASS (6 of 6), end-turn p95 1.48 ms PASS (budget 300 ms); the five balance gates
  SKIP until M1 (DESIGN_LOG 29).

### Simulation skeleton

- Integer-only `GameState` with canonical JSON and a SHA-256 state hash; saves with a versioned
  envelope, checksum and migration chain; `Rng` (xoshiro128**, stateless seeded streams);
  `Command`, `Result`, command queue with undo; `TurnProcessor` with the 14 phases in order;
  `Breakdown`, `ReportItem`, `WhyLog`; invariants; calendar. **Verified:**
  `godot --headless --path . -s tests/run_tests.gd`: 85 passed, 0 failed, 390 checks, 17 files.
- RNG test vectors come from an independent reference implementation, including the published
  xoshiro128** output for state {1, 2, 3, 4}. **Verified:** `--filter rng` (12 tests pass).
- Boundary scan: `sim/` names no nodes, input, UI or engine randomness. **Verified:**
  `--filter boundary` (2 tests pass).
- **Golden baseline created:** `tests/golden/tiny_hashes.json` (seed 20970401, 12 turns), made
  with `tools/regen_golden.gd`. Reason: "M0: first baseline of the phase skeleton".
  **Verified:** `--filter golden` (2 tests pass, including a save and load at every turn).
